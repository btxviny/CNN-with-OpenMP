# CNN-with-C-OpenMP
Cnn classifier on FMNIST with C and OpenMP

**Step 1 Run init.c to assign random weights to model **
**Step 2 Convert training labels to one-hot-encoding by running one_hot_encoding.c **
**Step 3 Run main.c to train the models on 60k pictures from the FMNIST Dataset **
**Step 4 Validate the Model by running test.c **
